       " 'dmitry konstantinovich belyayev (russian: дми́трий константи́нович беля́ев, 17 july 1917 – 14 november 1985) was a soviet geneticist and academician who served as director of the institute of cytology and genetics (ic&g) of the ussr academy of sciences, novosibirsk, from 1959 to 1985. his decades-long effort to breed domesticated silver foxes was described by the new york times as “arguably the most extraordinary breeding experiment ever conducted.”  a 2010 article in scientific american stated that belyayev “may be the man most responsible for our understanding of the process by which wolves were domesticated into our canine companions.”beginning in the 1950s, in order to uncover the genetic basis of the distinctive behavioral and physiological attributes of domesticated animals, belyayev and his team spent decades breeding the silver fox (vulpes vulpes) and selecting for reproduction only those individuals in each generation that showed the least fear of humans. after several generations of controlled breeding, a majority of the silver foxes no longer showed any fear of humans and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. they also began to display spotted coats, floppy ears, curled tails, as well as other physical attributes often found in domesticated animals, thus confirming belyayev’s hypothesis that both the behavioral and physical traits of domesticated animals could be traced to \"a collection of genes that conferred a propensity to tameness—a genotype that the foxes perhaps shared with any species that could be domesticated\".belyayev’s experiments were the result of a politically motivated demotion, in response to defying the now discredited non-mendellian theories of lysenkoism, which were politically accepted in the soviet union at the time. belyayev has since been vindicated in recent years by major scientific journals, and by the soviet establishment as a pioneering figure in modern genetics.\\n',\n",

       " ' he served as an advisor to presidents john f. kennedy and lyndon b. johnson, and was a consultant to the united states treasury, the bureau of the budget and the president\\'s council of economic advisers. samuelson wrote a weekly column for newsweek magazine along with chicago school economist milton friedman, where they represented opposing sides: samuelson, as a self described \"cafeteria keynesian\", claimed taking the keynesian perspective but only accepting what he felt was good in it. by contrast, friedman represented the monetarist perspective. together with henry wallich, their 1967 columns earned the magazine a gerald loeb special award in 1968.samuelson worked in many theoretical fields, including: consumer theory; welfare economics; capital; finance, particularly the efficient-market hypothesis; public finance, particularly optimal allocation; international economics, particularly the balassa–samuelson effect and the heckscher–ohlin model; macroeconomics, particularly the overlapping generations model; and market economics. \\n',\n",

       " ' cass made important contributions to pure economic theory, mostly in the field of general equilibrium theory. he made major contributions to the theory of optimal growth, the theory of sunspots and the theory of incomplete markets. he is perhaps best known for his article “optimum growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation”, which was a part of his dissertation. in this paper he proves a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by frank ramsey. a major difference to the standard ramsey growth model was that cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted, thus implicitly assuming that consumers prefer consumption today to consumption tomorrow. this modified version of the ramsey growth model is also known as the ramsey-cass-koopmans model, named after frank ramsey, david cass and tjalling koopmans.he was also famous for the \"cass criterion\" for overlapping generations models and in the neoclassical growth model, and his work, together with karl shell, on the influence of extrinsic uncertainty on economic equilibria, also known as the concept of sunspot equilibria or the theory of sunspots. together with joseph stiglitz he proved conditions under which it is possible for an investor to achieve an optimal portfolio under the restriction of being able to buy only two mutual funds. they also showed that generally the demand for money can not be derived from portfolio theory. cass was also a major contributor to the theory of incomplete markets, the turnpike theory and theory of economies with markets that repeatedly open over time.\\n',\n",

       " \" cass's paper was the first to endogenize the consumption-savings decision by deriving an optimal capital accumulation trajectory that maximized the discounted sum of utility payoffs over time.  the tools that cass used to derive his results were from the then-newly developed field of optimal control in mathematics pioneered by lev pontryagin.  the main results in the paper are a demonstration that under now-standard assumptions on preferences and technology, the optimal accumulation sequence exists and is unique.\\n\",\n",

       " \" the paper demonstrated that in static arrow-debreu economies with complete markets, extrinsic uncertainty (where no fundamentals of the model are stochastic) cannot matter to equilibrium allocations.  they then showed that when some agents were restricted in their trades, so that market completeness was violated, sunspots could matter, i.e. there could exist rational expectations equilibria in which equilibrium prices depended on the realization of an extrinsic stochastic process.  in passing, they made the observation that since the validity of the first welfare theorem implied that there could be no sunspot equilibria, a necessary condition for the existence of such equilibria was a violation of the conditions under which the first welfare theorem holds.  this observation took on a life of its own as what shell called the philadelphia pholk theorem:  if the first welfare theorem doesn't hold, then you can find an economy where sunspots matter.\\n\",\n",
       " ' in addition to raising troubling questions about what the right state space was for dynamic stochastic economies, the notion of sunspot equilibrium raised a number of deep questions about the overall determinacy of economic equilibria and the role of the welfare theorems in the occurrence or non-occurrence of sunspot equilibria.  these questions spawned a large literature on determinacy in dynamic economies in which the welfare theorems broke down.  these include overlapping generations models, growth models with externalities or taxes, and models in which asset markets were incomplete.  all were shown to allow the existence of sunspot equilibria.  and, in a suitable twist of intellectual fate, macroeconomists have recently begun to explore the question of whether sunspot expectations can provide a more plausible source of fluctuations in dynamic equilibrium models than the conventional aggregate productivity disturbances.\\n',\n",
       " ' cass’s third major contribution to economic theory was his work on general equilibrium with incomplete markets, work which grew out of his exploration of the question of existence of sunspot equilibria in models with incomplete asset markets.  cass’s follow-on work on existence and determinacy of general equilibrium in models with incomplete asset markets spawned another large literature which has come to be known simply as gei.  as an historical note, cass never really liked this terminology, preferring instead to think of these models as ones of general financial equilibrium (gfe) to emphasize the presence of financial assets and the frictions these introduced.\\n',\n",
       " ' the earliest work on market incompleteness goes back to arrow in the 1950s, diamond in the mid-‘60’s and a number of related papers in the finance literature between the late 1950s and early ‘70’s (geanakoplos  provides an excellent survey of this literature).  the canonical gei model was formulated by radner in the early 1970s in a paper which also pointed up one of the fundamental puzzles about models with incomplete markets: the possible loss of dimensionality in the span of the asset payoffs as prices vary.\\n',\n",
       " ' this potential for non-existence of equilibrium (which was formally developed in hart’s counterexamples to existence of equilibrium) left the literature in limbo for almost a decade, until cass’s work on existence in economies with purely financial assets pointed the way out.  as geanakoplos notes\\n',\n",
       " ' \\n',\n",
       " ' suddenly in the middle 1980s the pure theory of gei fell into place.  in two provocative and influential papers, cass showed that the existence of equilibrium could be guaranteed if all the assets promise delivery in fiat money, and he gave an example showing that with such financial assets there could be a multiplicity of equilibrium.  almost simultaneously werner also gave a proof of existence of equilibrium with financial assets, and geanakoplos and polemarchakis showed the same for economies with real assets that promise delivery in the same consumption good.the first paper that geanakoplos references above appeared initially in april 1984 as a caress working paper.\\n',\n",
       " ' this work was followed very quickly by results showing that the non-existence problem pointed out by hart was not generic, and led ultimately to the generic existence results of duffie and shafer, and again spawned a new literature looking positively at the welfare implication of market incompleteness, and normatively at issues of asset engineering.\\n',\n",

       " 'emil hans willi hennig (20 april 1913 – 5 november 1976) was a german biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. in 1945 as a prisoner of war, hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in german in 1950, with a substantially revised english translation published in 1966. with his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. as a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (true flies).\\n',\n",
       " ' hennig coined the key terms synapomorphy, symplesiomorphy and paraphyly. he also asserted, in his \"auxiliary principle\", that \"the presence of apomorphous characters in different species \\'is always reason for suspecting kinship [i.e., that species belong to a monophyletic group], and that their origin by convergence should not be presumed a priori\\' (hennig, 1953). this was based on the conviction that \\'phylogenetic systematics would lose all ground on which it stands\\' if the presence of apomorphous characters in different species were considered first of all as convergences (or parallelisms), with proof to the contrary required in each case.\"  this has been viewed as an application of the parsimony principle to the interpretation of characters, an important component of phylogenetic inference.he is also remembered for hennig\\'s progression rule in cladistics, which argues controversially that the most primitive species are found in the earliest, central part of a group\\'s area.\\n',\n",
